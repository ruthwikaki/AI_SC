PRODUCT DATA:
{product_data}

SERVICE LEVEL: {service_level}

LEAD TIME DATA:
{lead_time_data}

HISTORICAL DEMAND:
{demand_data}

Apply the following formula for safety stock calculation:
Safety Stock = Z-score Ã— Standard Deviation of Demand during Lead Time

Where:
- Z-score is derived from the service level (e.g., 1.645 for 95% service level)
- Standard Deviation of Demand during Lead Time incorporates both demand and lead time variability

For each product, provide:
1. Calculated safety stock level
2. Explanation of calculation
3. Recommendations for inventory policy

- "calculations": Array of product calculations
- "methodology": Brief explanation of calculation method
